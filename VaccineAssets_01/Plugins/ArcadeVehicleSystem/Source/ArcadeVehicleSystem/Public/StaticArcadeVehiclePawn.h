/**
* Base class of the arcade vehicle. Because I want to keep this plugin as flexible as possible,
* the whole vehicle movement is done entirely inside the single component,
* so you may or may not use this pawn. You can absolutely create your own pawn without
* deriving from this class. However, it's common to use this class as base, because it implements tiny bits
* so that the vehicle is ready to go.
* This pawn is designed for the vehicles using Static Mesh Component!
