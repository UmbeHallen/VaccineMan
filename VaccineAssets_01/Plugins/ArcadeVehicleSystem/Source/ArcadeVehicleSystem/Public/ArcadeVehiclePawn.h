  * Base class of the arcade vehicle. Because I want to keep this plugin as flexible as possible,
  * the whole vehicle movement is done entirely inside the single component,
  * so you may or may not use this pawn. You can absolutely create your own pawn without
  * deriving from this class. However, it's common to use this class as base, because it implements tiny bits
  * so that the vehicle is ready to go.
  * This pawn is designed for the vehicles using Skeletal Mesh Component!
